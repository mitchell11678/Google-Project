# Google-Project

Created by Mitchell Brown
Guided by The Odin Project (theodinproject.com)

This is a project given by The Odin Project to beginning web developers. The intention is to test a peron's basic skills and understanding of HTML and CSS.

Personal Report on Finished Product:

I finished the whole thing over the course of two days, it took me about 4-5 hours to complete in total. I learned a lot along the way, and in retrospect there is a lot I could do to clean up the code. However I think I did very well considering this was my first real web-page. I also learned to make commits more often. The gap between my fourth and fifth commit was a couple of hours of work. After that I made sure to commit after I finished a change to an element. All-in-all this was a very good first html/css project and it really tests to make sure you know what you're doing before you progress further in your understanding of web-development.

This particular project is in the web-development 101 course. The specific project can be fount at the following address:
